# Using-Python-load-CSVs-into-Database
Save huge time as well as energy using python which loads multiple csv into database in few seconds (table creation and data insertion in seconds)

## Objective:
The objective is to showcase how Python can be used to load multiple CSV files into a database quickly and efficiently.


## Technologies Used:
1. Python: Programming language used for scripting
2. Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis, particularly useful for handling CSV files.
3. SQLAlchemy: Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library used for interacting with various SQL databases.
4. MS SQL Server: Relational database management system (RDBMS) used as the target database.

## Steps:
1. Download dataset from websites like kaggle or any other
2. In case if you don't have editor, python and database, please download and install
3. Set-Up database connection and check if it's up and running
4. Open editor (I am using Visual Studio Code) -> terminal -> run command Python --version
6. Install SQLAlchemy which facilitates interaction with relational databases from Python applications. After installing SQLAlchemy, you can start using it in your Python projects to interact with databases

8. Create one file using extension .py and start writing script (refer load_csv.py)
9. Run command python load_csv.py to check success or error
